# CSE-310--Compiler-Sessional

## Overview

This is a C compiler that performs some lexical, syntax and semantic error checking with the help of Flex (lexer) and Bison (YACC parser) and then converts the C code to 8086 assembly language code. It is not a complete C compiler but covers most of the basic features of the language.
